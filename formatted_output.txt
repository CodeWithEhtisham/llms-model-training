6.3 Driving Business Excellence
The Corporate Performance Team (CPT) of the Institute plays a vital role in advancing IsDBI’s strategic
goals, making sure that its activities support its vision and mission for the long term. In 2023, the
team made remarkable progress in improving IsDBI’s performance indicators, strengthening data-
based decision making, and fostering a culture of ongoing improvement across the Institute. The
following are some of the main accomplishments in 2023.
6.3.1 Strategic Alignment
The team successfully aligned institutional goals
with the IsDBI’s overarching strategy, ensuring a
unified direction and consistent focus on priority
areas. During the year, strategic administrative
decisions have been issued, such as updating
the Special Allocation Guidelines (SAG), creating
a new in-house projects committee, and
developing a new project completion report.
6.3.2 Performance Metrics Enhancement
Through rigorous analysis and stakeholder
engagement, the team enhanced IsDBI’s
suite of performance metrics, providing more
insights into operational efficiency, client
satisfaction, and financial performance. The
team worked closely with other business units
to develop, review, and recommend policies
and procedures for institutional effectiveness.
The team has coordinated and participated
in institutional development, performance
evaluation, assessment, and planning. The team
shared timely information accurately with the
management.


6.3.3 Process Optimization and Quality
Assurance
The team led several initiatives to streamline
processes, improving workflow efficiency and
cost savings. Notable achievements include the
implementation of a new project management
framework and the automation of key reporting
processes. IsDBI updated its monitoring
framework to screen the quality of the projects.
During the year, the team coordinated with the
project officers to apply the project guidelines
to the ongoing projects.
In 2023, the IsDBI initiated the harmonization
process of all the projects with IsDB’s digital
application, the Operations Management Solutions
(OMS) system, with its own Project Management
Center. Henceforth, the OMS system and PM Center
will be the co-source for Islamic finance grant
projects. Within both systems, the Institute will be
able to reduce the life cycle of the projects and
deliver effective coordination with the other relevant
departments of the IsDBG. In 2023, the Institute
initiated a new methodology for the pipeline, under
implementation, and “need to be closed” projects.


Additionally, the team managed the business
and OMS processes for the Institute’s entire
portfolio. It reviewed and cleared the deliverables,
disbursements, amendments of the Islamic finance
grant, capacity building, and awareness projects.
Integrating into the IsDBG operations and creating
its project management system helped the Institute
achieve high efficiency. In addition, the following
benefits have been achieved:
- More performance measurements have been
developed to improve project management and
effectiveness.
- The quality of the project deliverables has been
improved.
- Project life cycles have been shortened, thereby
boosting productivity.
- Possible project complications have been
minimized.
- Teams have enhanced the integration process, and
effective project execution and completion have
been achieved.

Ultimately, the Institute has operated its
projects more profitably and cost-effectively
from their creation to closures. During the
year, the checklists have been used for project
amendments, extensions, peer reviews, and
scope changes. Looking ahead, the team
remains committed to driving excellence across
the IsDBI. Key focus areas for the upcoming year
include:
- Further Enhancing Performance Metrics:
Continuously refining and expanding IsDBI’s
performance metrics to provide a comprehensive
view of organizational performance.
- Leveraging Technology: Exploring innovative
technologies and tools to further enhance IsDBI’s
analytics capabilities and drive operational
efficiency.
- Strengthening Collaboration: Fostering greater
collaboration across the IsDBI to ensure alignment
of goals, sharing of best practices, and collective
achievement of strategic objectives.
The CPT will continue to play a pivotal role in the
Institute in the years to come, through focus on
excellence, data-driven insights, and employee
engagement.
