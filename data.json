    "text":"Chapter 2 Islamic Finance Sector Transformation This chapter reports the accomplishments in leading the transformation of the Islamic financial industry through various initiatives.2.1 Leading the Islamic Finance Industry One of the key functions of IsDBI is to lead the development of an enabling environment for Islamic finance to serve as a catalyst for achieving the development goals of MCs. In this respect, IsDBI supports diverse sectors through different types of interventions. The varying nature of interventions, depending on the needs of the beneficiary country/organisation, includes development of legal and regulatory frameworks, country masterplans, thematic policies, capacity building, products development, technology- aided solutions, and technical support in applying standards of best practices in the Islamic finance industry. The interventions aim to reinforce the impact of Islamic finance on sustainable development and to promote inclusive growth and economic stability. Box 2.1: Objectives of the Islamic Finance Sector Transformation Program A. To support the transformation and development of the Islamic finance industry to support sustainable development. B. To contribute to the creation of an enabling environment (legal, regulatory, and supervisory frameworks) for the development of the Islamic financial services industry in the IsDB MCs. C. To facilitate the standardization and harmonization of the practice of Islamic finance across IsDB MCs. 2.2 Islamic Finance Grants Program As part of its leadership role in developing Islamic finance ecosystems, the Institute has revitalised the Islamic Finance Grants Program to support the transformation and development of the Islamic Financial Services Industry (IFSI). The grants program, historically known as the Islamic finance technical assistance programme, has been one of the core intervention instruments of the IsDB Group in shaping the global Islamic finance landscape. The funding for the program comes from the Islamic Finance Special Allocation approved by the IsDB Board of Governors in 2013 and subsequently renewed over time with the latest extension for the use of the funds during the period 2022-25. The objectives of the program include supporting IFSI stakeholders, through grant projects, to create an enabling environment for all the sectors of the Islamic finance industry in their respective jurisdictions. These stakeholders typically include central banks, ministries of finance, capital market ANNUAL REPORT 2023 authorities, other regulatory and supervisory agencies, commercial and investment banks, takaful companies, and other financial services stakeholders. In addition to IsDB Member and Non-Member Country stakeholders, Islamic finance grants are also offered to Islamic finance infrastructure institutions for developing standards, guidelines, and best practices for the Islamic Financial Services Industry (see more in Section 2.4). Grant projects typically kick-off with scoping to understand beneficiary needs and identifying issue areas. Once these areas are identified, a suitable intervention mechanism will be designed. Afterward, the grant will be approved, and the implementation stage will begin. This stage will comprise the execution of the grant project, financial disbursements, technical advisory, and achievement of the program objectives leading to project completion. 23In the past 10 years (2013-23), a total of 175 Islamic Finance Grant projects were programmed worth nearly US$ 21.7 million in commitments 1 . Among these, 95 projects have been successfully completed benefiting more than 35 IsDB MCs and non-MCs. The program has also supported more than 10 international partner organisations including the Islamic finance infrastructure Institutions. These interventions have paved the way for introducing and strengthening Islamic finance worldwide by creating the requisite enabling environment consisting of legal, regulatory, and supervisory frameworks, building local capacities, and transferring knowledge Focusing on the year 2023, the Institute programmed and approved 15 new technical assistance projects of about US$ 2.3 million for various countries and international organizations. These were Nigeria, Kazakhstan, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Mauritania, International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), International Islamic Financial Market (IIFM), Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB), and Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI). The new projects approved in 2013 were in addition to the 67 already approved projects that are under implementation. Additionally, 10 technical assistance projects launched earlier were completed in 2023 worth a total of US$ 923,000. Overall, the technical assistance portfolio supports a wide spectrum of technical work areas including Islamic banking, Islamic capital markets, Takaful as well as the Islamic social finance sector. 2.3 Flagship Transformation Projects IsDBI’s flagship projects focus on identifying and aiming to address the most pressing challenges in the MCs. The projects leverage Islamic finance and technology to create strategic and holistic solutions to address the identified issues. The objectives are to engage in innovation and produce practical solutions to the development needs; help in facilitating the enhanced business and economic relations among IsDB MCs; and support mainstreaming Islamic finance in IsDB MCs. For each flagship project, the activities include identifying a specific development challenge, proposing innovative solutions, testing proof-of- concept, generating feasibility reports, and pilot implementation of the solution. Currently, four flagship projects are at various stages of implementation, as follows: - Awqaf Free Zones: This project aims to innovatively combine the concepts of Awqaf, Free Zones, and technology in mobilizing resources for sustainable development, focusing on food and energy security. Feasibility reports for this project are expected to be completed by the end of 2024. - OIC Smart Countertrade System: The project aims to facilitate trade transactions between parties in the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), to be settled through digital countertrade means without using currency. Feasibility reports are due for completion by the end of 2024. - Digital Postal Islamic Financial Services Project: This project seeks to synergize digital technologies with Islamic financial instruments within the postal networks. This innovative approach aims to revolutionize financial inclusion, especially in underserved regions. The Institute has started creating awareness about the project through its participation in the first edition of the Africa Postal Leaders Forum organized by the Universal Postal Union in July 2023. Market studies are due for completion by the end of 2024. ANNUAL REPORT 2023 - Islamic Finance Sector Mapping Framework (IF-MAP): This important tool for building the Islamic finance sector in MCs is a holistic diagnostic and remedial Islamic finance ecosystem toolkit now under the pilot implementation stage. In 2023, assessments were completed for Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, and preliminary discussions were held with Nigeria, Morocco and Turkiye for 2024 assessments. 2.4 Islamic Finance Infrastructure Institutions The rapid expansion of the global Islamic finance industry over the last decade or two has brought about the need for regulatory and policies standardization and harmonization across different countries and jurisdictions. In response to this need, the IsDB created the Islamic Finance Infrastructure Institutions Program aiming to coordinate, support, and technically contribute towards the six institutions established by the IsDB. These are AAOIFI, General Council for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions (CIBAFI), IFSB, IIFM, Islamic International Ratings Agency (IIRA), and International Islamic Centre for Reconciliation and Arbitration (IICRA). The key mode of engagement by IsDB is through participation in the governing bodies of these institutions, technical committees, working groups and task forces, as well as other operational and technical coordination activities. Through this support, the IIIs have issued more than 200 standards of best practices on diverse technical topics for the global Islamic financial services industry covering all sectors including banking, capital markets, takaful and social finance. The IsDB Institute manages the IsDB Group’s coordination with these institutions, including membership matters, events coordination, technical work programs, senior management representation in meetings, and professional staff inputs into the technical work programs. In 2023, the IsDBI managed all the coordination matters for these institutions on behalf of the IsDB. 25Box 2.2: Goals of the Islamic Finance Infrastructure Institutions Program A. To coordinate, support, and technically contribute towards the Islamic finance infrastructure institutions established by the IsDB. B. To help the Islamic Infrastructure Institutions become credible standard-setting institutions that play an instrumental role in the harmonization and standardization of Islamic finance practice. C. To support Islamic Finance Infrastructure Institutions become self-sustaining institutions and reliable points of reference. 2.5 Knowledge Creation & Dissemination A key function of the Institute is to produce and disseminate knowledge on how to tackle the development issues facing MCs within the principles of Islamic economics. This involves exploring the areas where Islamic finance and sustainable development can converge and benefit MCs’ economic and financial goals. The Institute publishes its research findings in various formats, such as books, reports, and articles, covering a wide range of topics related to Islamic economics, finance and sustainable development. In 2023, more than 10 publications were issued covering a range of topics in Islamic economics and development.

[For more, see Chapter 5 and Annex 5]. 2.6 Islamic Financial Products The Institute develops innovative Islamic finance products aimed at addressing the market and developmental needs of the IsDB MCs. This helps champion breakthrough ideas and products that can potentially become solutions to the economic development problem of IsDB MCs. In 2023, the Institute worked on several innovative products, namely Sukuk Enhancement Fund, Results-Based Financing Mechanism, the use of takaful as a resilient product for addressing climate challenges, and a product for addressing women’s financial inclusion through Islamic finance. These initiatives were conducted in coordination with various partners both within the IsDB Group and externally. 2.7 IsDB Prize for Impactful Achievement in Islamic Economics The IsDB Prize for Impactful Achievement in Islamic Economics, coordinated by the Institute, aims to recognize outstanding achievements in knowledge creation and innovative development solutions guided by the principles of Islamic economics. The Institute manages the prestigious prize, including all processes of nominations, screening, selection, award approvals, and presentation ceremony. The Institute similarly organizes or collaborates in knowledge dissemination programs to raise greater awareness and understanding of Islamic finance, and promote Islamic financial literacy. Such programs include conferences, workshops, seminars, and webinars. Among the high-profile ANNUAL REPORT 2023 26In 2023, a novel financing mechanism, “Cash Waqf Linked Sukuk (CWLS),” was selected as the first- place winner of the prize under the Development Achievement category.

    "text":"Chapter 4 Fintech Solutions This chapter focuses on the Institute’s work in developing fintech solutions to address challenges facing IsDB MCs.4.1 Synergizing Tech with Islamic Finance IsDBI has continued to lead the way in synergizing knowledge technologies with Islamic finance to develop fintech solutions addressing contemporary socio-economic challenges. Leveraging innovative technologies and strategic partnerships, the Institute in 2023 embarked on numerous ambitious projects for cutting-edge solutions in Islamic finance and technology. 4.2 Smart Stabilization System In 2023, IsDBI kicked off building a prototype for the patent-pending Smart Stabilization System (SSS). A groundbreaking innovation in the field of financial technology, the SSS is designed to stabilize asset markets by effectively managing supply-demand gaps. This forward-looking system contrasts traditional stabilization methods by focusing on proactive rather than reactive measures. The in-depth analysis conducted by the Institute demonstrated the system’s potential to significantly reduce the volatility of the traded asset without the need for capital or external reserves. The system has already gained international recognition with a favorable assessment from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) on 11 December 2023, affirming its uniqueness and potential for patentability. WIPO acknowledgement is not only a testament to the system’s ingenuity but also underlines IsDBI’s role as a leader in the fintech sector. ANNUAL REPORT 2023 In collaboration with SettleMint, a leader in blockchain technology, a workable demonstration of the SSS is being developed with a focus on inclusivity and accessibility across various asset classes, including shares, sukuk, digital currencies, and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Phase 1 covers the development of the Proof-of-concept of the SSS. This will be followed by “Developing and Testing” (Phase 2) and “Production and Deployment” (Phase 3). This initiative is a significant step towards enhancing financial stability in the digital and crypto-based economy. Box 4.1: The Smart Stabilization System The Smart Stabilization System is an algorithm for stabilizing the value of assets or coins traded on centralized exchanges. The main idea of the System is that the gap between supply and demand can be managed to reduce the volatility of the price while maintaining the role of the gap in adjusting prices. The System is unique in several important aspects: 1. It is self-funded. 2. It acts before price changes. 3. It protects the rights of investors. Simulation results show significant improvement in the stability of not only price but also the volume of transactions. The algorithm is currently patent pending with the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS). 334.3 Islamic Finance AI Assistant The year 2023 witnessed the development of the Islamic Finance Artificial Intelligence Assistant (IFAA), a cutting-edge tool designed to democratize access to Islamic finance knowledge. Powered by advanced AI algorithms, IFAA provides comprehensive insights into IsDB Group’s and other publicly available publications and data, making complex Islamic financial concepts accessible to a broader audience. IFAA allows users to query and summarize reports quickly to get to the main points. It also offers insights into the intricacies of Islamic financial principles in a conversational and accessible manner using the latest AI technologies and Large Language Models such as ChatGPT. IFAA’s capabilities in report summarization and elucidation of Islamic financial principles have been remarkable. The IFAA is undergoing additional testing and is expected to be launched in Q1, 2024. Looking ahead, IsDBI plans to expand IFAA’s functionalities into various realms, including AI-based assistants for legal and regulatory frameworks, the grants program, progress reporting, and Islamic finance training. This expansion is aimed at enhancing decision-making processes and fostering a deeper understanding of Islamic finance.

    "text":"Chapter 6 Strengthening Institutional Effectiveness This chapter covers the Institute’s programs and activities related to strengthening internal governance and operational effectiveness.6.1 Board of Trustees The Board of Trustees (BOT) is an advisory organ mandated to provide guidance and direction on the Institute’s strategy, medium-term work program, and budget. The Board comprises eminent personalities from various professional backgrounds in both the public and private sectors, who are appointed for a 3-year renewable term. H.E. the Chairman of the IsDB Group is also the Chairman of the Board of Trustees. The Board meets at least once a year. In 2023, the Board held its 12th meeting during which the members commented on the Institute’s groundbreaking smart projects dedicated to advancing sustainable economic resilience in IsDB MCs. The Board Members expressed delight over the Institute’s performance, congratulating its management and staff on the key initiatives and achievements. Furthermore, the Board commended the Institute’s leadership role in integrating modern technologies with Islamic finance to foster socio-economic development. 6.2 IsDBI Project Management Center To enhance efficiency and effectiveness in project execution, IsDBI has developed a dedicated Project Management Center (PMC), which marks an important stride towards implementation of its strategy and facilitating enhanced reporting to the Management on core activities of the Institute. The center aims to centralize and streamline project management processes and is dedicated to guiding the IsDBI business units towards the successful execution of projects, ensuring alignment with client expectations. PMC’s main objectives are to (i) enhance the monitoring of resources use to maximize efficiency, (ii) refine project management processes, (iii) improve the process flow and ensure robust involvement of all stakeholders; (iv) increase the productivity and operational efficiency ANNUAL REPORT 2023 of projects; and (v) offer a comprehensive dashboard for effective reporting on project progress. In 2023, the first phase of this initiative was successfully implemented for all IsDBI projects. This phase involved integrating the platform with the IsDB Knowledge Platform in partnership with the IsDB IT Department. The next phases will focus on improving the user interface and developing reporting dashboards. These dashboards will allow Management and project members to monitor and track programs and projects more easily and quickly. The initiative will also enable the generation of real-time quarterly performance reports directly on the platform. 476.3 Driving Business Excellence The Corporate Performance Team (CPT) of the Institute plays a vital role in advancing IsDBI’s strategic goals, making sure that its activities support its vision and mission for the long term. In 2023, the team made remarkable progress in improving IsDBI’s performance indicators, strengthening data- based decision making, and fostering a culture of ongoing improvement across the Institute. The following are some of the main accomplishments in 2023. 6.3.1 Strategic Alignment The team successfully aligned institutional goals with the IsDBI’s overarching strategy, ensuring a unified direction and consistent focus on priority areas. During the year, strategic administrative decisions have been issued, such as updating the Special Allocation Guidelines (SAG), creating a new in-house projects committee, and developing a new project completion report. 6.3.2 Performance Metrics Enhancement Through rigorous analysis and stakeholder engagement, the team enhanced IsDBI’s suite of performance metrics, providing more insights into operational efficiency, client satisfaction, and financial performance. The team worked closely with other business units to develop, review, and recommend policies and procedures for institutional effectiveness. The team has coordinated and participated in institutional development, performance evaluation, assessment, and planning. The team shared timely information accurately with the management. 6.3.3 Process Optimization and Quality Assurance The team led several initiatives to streamline processes, improving workflow efficiency and cost savings. Notable achievements include the implementation of a new project management framework and the automation of key reporting processes. IsDBI updated its monitoring framework to screen the quality of the projects. During the year, the team coordinated with the project officers to apply the project guidelines to the ongoing projects. ANNUAL REPORT 2023 In 2023, the IsDBI initiated the harmonization process of all the projects with IsDB’s digital application, the Operations Management Solutions (OMS) system, with its own Project Management Center. Henceforth, the OMS system and PM Center will be the co-source for Islamic finance grant projects. Within both systems, the Institute will be able to reduce the life cycle of the projects and deliver effective coordination with the other relevant departments of the IsDBG. In 2023, the Institute initiated a new methodology for the pipeline, under implementation, and “need to be closed” projects. Additionally, the team managed the business and OMS processes for the Institute’s entire portfolio. It reviewed and cleared the deliverables, disbursements, amendments of the Islamic finance grant, capacity building, and awareness projects. Integrating into the IsDBG operations and creating its project management system helped the Institute achieve high efficiency. In addition, the following benefits have been achieved: - More performance measurements have been developed to improve project management and effectiveness. - The quality of the project deliverables has been improved. - Project life cycles have been shortened, thereby boosting productivity. - Possible project complications have been minimized. - Teams have enhanced the integration process, and effective project execution and completion have been achieved. 48Ultimately, the Institute has operated its projects more profitably and cost-effectively from their creation to closures. During the year, the checklists have been used for project amendments, extensions, peer reviews, and scope changes. Looking ahead, the team remains committed to driving excellence across the IsDBI. Key focus areas for the upcoming year include: - Further Enhancing Performance Metrics: Continuously refining and expanding IsDBI’s performance metrics to provide a comprehensive view of organizational performance. - Leveraging Technology: Exploring innovative technologies and tools to further enhance IsDBI’s analytics capabilities and drive operational efficiency. - Strengthening Collaboration: Fostering greater collaboration across the IsDBI to ensure alignment of goals, sharing of best practices, and collective achievement of strategic objectives. The CPT will continue to play a pivotal role in the Institute in the years to come, through focus on excellence, data-driven insights, and employee engagement.",
