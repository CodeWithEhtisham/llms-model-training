The key areas of activities of the Institute in 2023 include: Islamic Finance Sector Transformation A program that supports the transformation and development of the Islamic Financial Services Industry (IFSI) through implementing Islamic finance grant projects. The program covers various technical work areas, including Islamic banking, capital markets, Takaful, and Islamic social finance. In 2023, the Institute programmed and approved 14 new technical assistance projects worth about US$ 2.3 million in Nigeria, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Mauritania, and with partner international organizations. Twelve projects launched earlier were also completed worth a total of US$ 923,000. An important tool for building the Islamic finance sector in MCs is the Islamic Finance Sector Mapping Framework (IF-MAP). This is a holistic diagnostic and remedial Islamic finance ecosystem toolkit now under the pilot implementation stage. In 2023, assessments were completed for Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, and preliminary discussions were held with Nigeria, Morocco and Turkiye for 2024 assessments. Knowledge Creation & Dissemination The Institute provides market insights and practical analysis for addressing the development challenges of MCs. This program involves conducting research and publishing books, reports, and articles on diverse topics in Islamic economics, finance, and sustainable development. More than 10 publications were issued in 2023. Furthermore, IsDBI developed a cloud reader that grants access to the Institute\u2019s online bookstore, a massive knowledge repository for Islamic economics and finance publications. Capacity Building Developing human capital is a core mandate of the Institute through organization of training programs, executive programs, knowledge seminars, and other forms of capacity building using both traditional and modern technology-based learning methods. In 2023, the Institute organized 13 capacity- building programs on diverse topics for the benefit of external as well as internal stakeholders.

{"prompt": "what are the Strategic Objectives in annual report 2023?", "completion": "1.2 Strategic Objectives The Institute\u2019s strategic direction is formulated based on the \u201cBlue Ocean Strategy.\u201d This means searching for fresh (blue) waters with the potential for delivering high value, while avoiding crowded areas (red water). In practice, this refers to the pursuit of opportunities and activities that create added value at minimum cost. The Institute avoids replication of the work of other organisations, and capitalises on its comparative advantages to uniquely position itself. In light of this strategy, the Institute adopted four Strategic Objectives as follows:\n1. Creating Value through Knowledge-based Innovations: The Institute primarily focuses on identifying innovative ways to make its business cost- effective, competitive, and client oriented. As the IsDB Group is fully committed to the SDGs, the Institute champions the implementation of the Global Goals according to the needs and priorities of the MCs. The Institute harnesses its intellectual expertise and teams up with leading industry partners to develop innovative, knowledge-based solutions that respond to MCs\u2019 challenges. While guiding the innovation process toward maximum value for MCs, the Institute continues to uphold the principles of Islamic economics and finance.\n2. Building Human Capital:The core of any sustainable development strategy is human capital. Therefore, the Institute employs frontier technologies, and applies a sustainable set of human values at the core of its business, to formulate unique programmes for building the next generation of knowledge leaders and entrepreneurs to lead the development of MCs. The Institute aims to lead in providing learning and capacity building to support MCs in achieving the SDGs.\n3. Adopting a Problem-Solving Approach: IsDBI adopts an up-to-date problem-solving approach to find authentic and real-time solutions to MCs\u2019 economic impediments. Hence, the Institute focuses on applied and productive studies, translating intellectual creativity to real- world applications. This will enable the Institute to distinguish itself from and complement academia, consulting firms, and related industry players.\n4. Creating Strong Partnerships and Networks: Over the years, the Institute has leveraged its accumulated knowledge and experience in Islamic Finance to collaborate with local and international development institutions. IsDBI continues to play a unique role in working with its stakeholders and future partners to support MCs\u2019 development via innovative systems and state-of-the-art technologies guided by the principles of Islamic Finance."}

The grants program, historically known as the Islamic finance technical assistance programme, has been one of the core intervention instruments of the IsDB Group in shaping the global Islamic finance landscape. The funding for the program comes from the Islamic Finance Special Allocation approved by the IsDB Board of Governors in 2013 and subsequently renewed over time with the latest extension for the use of the funds during the period 2022-25.\nThe objectives of the program include supporting IFSI stakeholders, through grant projects, to create an enabling environment for all the sectors of the Islamic finance industry in their respective jurisdictions. These stakeholders typically include central banks, ministries of finance, capital market authorities, other regulatory and supervisory agencies, commercial and investment banks, takaful companies, and other financial services stakeholders. In addition to IsDB Member and Non-Member Country stakeholders, Islamic finance grants are also offered to Islamic finance infrastructure institutions for developing standards, guidelines, and best practices for the Islamic Financial Services Industry (see more in Section 2.4). Grant projects typically kick-off with scoping to understand beneficiary needs and identifying issue areas. Once these areas are identified, a suitable intervention mechanism will be designed. Afterward, the grant will be approved, and the implementation stage will begin. This stage will comprise the execution of the grant project, financial disbursements, technical advisory, and achievement of the program objectives leading to project completion.\nIn the past 10 years (2013-23), a total of 175 Islamic Finance Grant projects were programmed worth nearly US$ 21.7 million in commitments1. Among these, 95 projects have been successfully completed benefiting more than 35 IsDB MCs and non-MCs. The program has also supported more than 10 international partner organisations including the Islamic finance infrastructure Institutions. These interventions have paved the way for introducing and strengthening Islamic finance worldwide by creating the requisite enabling environment consisting of  legal, regulatory, and supervisory frameworks, building local capacities, and transferring knowledge\nFocusing on the year 2023, the Institute programmed and approved 15 new technical assistance projects of about US$ 2.3 million for various countries and international organizations. These were Nigeria, Kazakhstan, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Mauritania, International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), International Islamic Financial Market (IIFM), Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB), and Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI). The new projects approved in 2013 were in addition to the 67 already approved projects that are under implementation.\nAdditionally, 10 technical assistance projects launched earlier were completed in 2023 worth a total of US$ 923,000.
